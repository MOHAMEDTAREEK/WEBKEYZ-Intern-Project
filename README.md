# Webkeyz Intern Project – Backend Development

This project was developed during my internship at Webkeyz. It focuses on building a scalable backend system using TypeScript, Sequelize, Express.js, and MySQL. The backend powers an internal application designed to streamline various company processes, improve data management, and enhance team productivity.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an efficient backend infrastructure that supports internal operations for Webkeyz. It handles user authentication, data management, role-based access control, and integrates third-party services to enhance the application's functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and better development experience.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Sequelize ORM**: For database modeling and management with MySQL.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing and retrieving data.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication and session management.
- **Jest**: Testing framework to ensure code quality.
- **Nodemailer**: For email notifications and services integration.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Controls access to specific API endpoints based on user roles (admin, user, etc.).
- **Data Management**: Efficient handling of users, posts, and mentions.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration of external services and APIs to enhance functionality.
- **Scalable API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with a clear separation of concerns (route -> controller -> service -> repository).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MOHAMEDTAREEK/WEBKEYZ-Intern-Project.git
   cd WEBKEYZ-Intern-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   DB_HOST=your_db_host
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

- The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
- You can use tools like Postman or Curl to interact with the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint              | Method | Description                       | Authentication |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| `/api/auth/register`   | POST   | Register a new user               | No             |
| `/api/auth/login`      | POST   | Login and get access/refresh token| No             |
| `/api/user/profile`    | GET    | Get user profile                  | Yes            |
| `/api/user/mention`    | POST   | Mention another user              | Yes            |

## Database Schema

The project uses **MySQL** with Sequelize for database management. The core tables are:

- **User**: Stores user information, roles, and authentication data.
- **Mention**: Tracks user mentions within the system.

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** for unit and integration tests.

- Run tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
